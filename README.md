# Task Placement Strategies
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a managed service by AWS for running and scaling containerized applications. Task placement is how ECS decides where to place tasks (containers) on available EC2 instances, ensuring efficient resource use and high availability. Strategies and constraints help customize this process, balancing performance, cost, and fault tolerance.


### Key Points
- Task placement in Amazon ECS determines where containers run on EC2 instances, using strategies like random, binpack, and spread.
- Research suggests default strategies vary: services spread across availability zones, standalone tasks have no default.
- It seems likely that combining strategies (e.g., spread then binpack) optimizes resource use and availability.
- The evidence leans toward using constraints to enforce specific placement rules, like OS type or instance type.

### Placement Strategies
ECS offers three main strategies:
- **Random**: Places tasks randomly, useful for homogeneous instances.
- **Binpack**: Fits tasks on instances with least available CPU or memory, saving costs.
- **Spread**: Distributes tasks evenly, often across availability zones, for high availability.

### Default and Customization
For services, the default is to spread tasks across availability zones. Standalone tasks have no default strategy, requiring manual configuration. You can combine strategies, like spreading across zones then binpacking by memory, and update them for existing services.

### Placement Constraints
Constraints ensure tasks only run on instances meeting specific criteria, like OS type or instance type, and are mandatory unlike strategies, which are best-effort.

### Survey Note: Detailed Explanation of Task Placement Strategy in ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS, designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. A critical aspect of ECS is its task placement strategy, which determines how tasks (containers) are distributed across container instances (EC2 instances) within a cluster. This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of ECS task placement strategies, including their types, default behaviors, customization options, and integration with placement constraints, based on authoritative sources such as official AWS documentation and AWS Compute Blog posts.

#### Introduction to Task Placement
Task placement in ECS involves deciding which container instance will run a task when it is launched and which task to terminate when scaling down the task count. This process is essential for optimizing resource utilization, ensuring high availability, and maintaining fault tolerance. Before December 2016, custom task placement required manual scheduling via the `StartTask` API, limited to basic resource checks like CPU, memory, and ports. AWS introduced a task placement engine to eliminate the need for custom schedulers, using a funnel approach: first, constraints must be obeyed, then strategies sort the remaining instances for placement.

The placement process follows these steps:
1. Identify container instances that meet the task's resource requirements, such as CPU, GPU, memory, and port mappings.
2. Apply placement constraints to filter instances, ensuring they satisfy mandatory rules.
3. Apply placement strategies to determine the best placement from the filtered list.
4. Select the instance(s) for task placement.

When scaling down, ECS uses placement strategies to decide which tasks to terminate, ensuring balanced resource management.

#### Default Task Placement Strategies
The default placement strategy depends on whether tasks are part of a service or standalone:
- For tasks running as part of an ECS service, the default strategy is:
  - **Type**: `spread`
  - **Field**: `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`
  - This ensures tasks are distributed evenly across availability zones, maximizing fault tolerance and availability.
- For standalone tasks (not associated with a service), there is no default placement strategy, requiring explicit configuration when running tasks.

This distinction is important for users to understand, as it affects how tasks are initially placed without customization.

#### Types of Placement Strategies
ECS supports three placement strategies, each serving different use cases:

1. **Random**
   - **Description**: Places tasks randomly on available container instances that meet the resource and constraint requirements.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where instances are homogeneous, and there is no specific need for load balancing or optimization. It is the default for the `RunTask` API.
   - **Field**: Not applicable, as no specific attribute is required.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 5 --placement-strategy type="random"
     ```

2. **Binpack**
   - **Description**: Places tasks on container instances with the least available amount of CPU or memory, aiming to minimize the number of instances used. This strategy is particularly useful for cost optimization, as it consolidates tasks to reduce the number of active instances. When scaling down, it terminates tasks on instances that would have the most resources left after termination, ensuring efficient resource use.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for cost savings and elastic scaling, especially in environments where minimizing instance count is a priority.
   - **Field**: Must specify either `cpu` or `memory` to indicate the resource to optimize.
   - **Example Commands**:
     - Binpack by CPU:
       ```bash
       aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 8 --placement-strategy type="binpack",field="cpu"
       ```
     - Binpack by Memory:
       ```bash
       aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 8 --placement-strategy type="binpack",field="memory"
       ```

3. **Spread**
   - **Description**: Distributes tasks evenly across a specified attribute, such as instance IDs, availability zones, or custom attributes, to balance the load. This strategy maximizes availability by ensuring tasks are not concentrated on a single instance or zone. When scaling down, it balances task termination across the specified attribute, often prioritizing availability zones to maintain distribution.
   - **Use Case**: Essential for high availability and fault tolerance, especially in multi-zone deployments. It is the default for services using the `CreateService` API, typically with the field `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`.
   - **Field**: Can be any attribute, including:
     - `instanceId` (or `host`): Spreads tasks across different instances.
     - `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`: Spreads tasks across availability zones.
     - Custom attributes, such as `attribute:stack=prod` for environment-specific placement.
   - **Example Commands**:
     - Spread across availability zones:
       ```bash
       aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 8 --placement-strategy type="spread",field="attribute:ecs.availability-zone"
       ```
     - Spread across instances:
       ```bash
       aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 8 --placement-strategy type="spread",field="instanceId"
       ```

#### Combining Multiple Strategies
ECS allows combining up to 5 placement strategies, applied in the order specified. This chaining enables complex placement logic, such as first spreading tasks across availability zones for fault tolerance, then binpacking by memory for resource optimization. For example:
- Command to spread across zones then binpack by memory:
  ```bash
  aws ecs run-task --task-definition nouvelleApp --count 8 --placement-strategy type="spread",field="attribute:ecs.availability-zone" type="binpack",field="memory"
  ```
This approach ensures tasks are distributed for availability while also consolidating resources within each zone.

#### Placement Constraints
In addition to strategies, ECS supports placement constraints, which are mandatory rules that must be satisfied for a task to be placed on a container instance. If no instance meets the constraint, the task remains in the `PENDING` state, unlike strategies, which are best-effort.

- **Specification**: Constraints are defined using the `placementConstraint` parameter in service definitions, task definitions, or when running tasks. The structure is:
  ```json
  "placementConstraints": [
    {
      "expression": "The expression that defines the task placement constraints",
      "type": "The placement constraint type to use"
    }
  ]
  ```

- **Types of Constraints**:
  1. **distinctInstance**:
     - **Description**: Ensures each active task is placed on a different container instance. This is useful for isolating tasks for security or performance reasons.
     - **Note**: It considers the desired status of tasks; if an existing task is desired to be `STOPPED` but its last status isnâ€™t, it may allow another task on the same instance. For strong isolation, AWS recommends using AWS Fargate, as detailed in the [Security Overview of AWS Fargate](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Fargate_Security_Overview_Whitepaper.pdf).
  2. **memberOf**:
     - **Description**: Places tasks on container instances that satisfy an expression defined using the cluster query language. This allows fine-grained control based on instance attributes.

- **Attributes for memberOf**:
  - **Built-in Attributes**: Include `ecs.ami-id`, `ecs.availability-zone`, `ecs.instance-type`, `ecs.os-type` (values: `linux`, `windows`), `ecs.os-family` (e.g., `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_CORE`, etc.), `ecs.cpu-architecture` (e.g., `x86_64`, `arm64`), `ecs.vpc-id`, `ecs.subnet-id`.
  - **Optional Attributes**: Include `ecs.awsvpc-trunk-id`, `ecs.outpost-arn`, `ecs.capability.external`.
  - **Custom Attributes**: Users can define custom attributes with names (1-128 characters, letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, etc.) and values (1-128 characters, letters, numbers, hyphens, etc., no leading/trailing whitespace).

- **Example Usage**:
  - To ensure tasks are placed on instances with the same Windows version, use:
    ```json
    "placementConstraints": [
      {
        "type": "memberOf",
        "expression": "attribute:ecs.os-family == WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL"
      }
    ]
    ```
  - This is particularly useful for maintaining consistency in OS environments, as described in [Retrieving Amazon ECS-optimized Windows AMI metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/retrieve-ecs-optimized_windows_AMI.html).

#### Specification and Updates
Placement strategies and constraints are specified using the `placementStrategy` and `placementConstraint` parameters, respectively, in:
- Service definitions (e.g., when using `CreateService` or `UpdateService` APIs).
- Task definitions.
- When running tasks (e.g., via the `RunTask` API).

For example, in a service definition:
```json
{
  "placementStrategy": [
    {
      "type": "spread",
      "field": "attribute:ecs.availability-zone"
    },
    {
      "type": "binpack",
      "field": "memory"
    }
  ],
  "placementConstraints": [
    {
      "type": "memberOf",
      "expression": "attribute:ecs.instance-type == t3.medium"
    }
  ]
}
```
Strategies can be updated for existing services, providing flexibility to adapt to changing needs, as outlined in [How Amazon ECS places tasks on container instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html).

#### Best Practices and Considerations
To optimize ECS task placement, consider the following:
- **Default Strategy for Services**: Leverage the default `spread` strategy across availability zones for high availability, especially in multi-zone deployments.
- **Use Binpack for Cost Optimization**: Implement `binpack` to minimize the number of instances, reducing costs, particularly in elastic scaling scenarios.
- **Combine Strategies**: Use chained strategies to achieve both availability (spread) and efficiency (binpack), such as spreading across zones then binpacking by memory.
- **Constraints for Specific Needs**: Use constraints to enforce specific requirements, such as running tasks on particular instance types or OS versions, ensuring compliance with application needs.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Placement strategies are best-effort, meaning ECS will attempt to follow them but may not always succeed if optimal placement is unavailable. Monitor cluster health and adjust strategies as needed.
- **Avoid Overloading Instances**: Be cautious with `binpack` if tasks have varying resource needs, as it might lead to resource contention on heavily loaded instances, impacting performance.

#### Summary
The task placement strategy in Amazon ECS is a flexible and powerful feature for customizing how tasks are distributed across container instances. It includes three main strategiesâ€”random, binpack, and spreadâ€”each serving different purposes, with defaults varying by service type. Placement constraints complement strategies by enforcing mandatory rules, ensuring tasks meet specific criteria. By combining strategies and constraints, users can optimize for cost, availability, and performance, making ECS a robust solution for container orchestration.
